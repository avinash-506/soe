We recognize that every decision we make involves trade-offs and there is no easy and straightforward path to sustainability. However, we practise the following within each of the pillars</P>
      
        <h4 class="faq-que "  style="font-size:18px">Planet: </h4>
         <ol type="1">
        <li>Source materials responsibly, taking into consideration factors such as supplier due diligence, certifications, and locations
</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Organic cotton instead of conventional cotton</li>
          <li>GOTS/OEKO-TEX Certified facilities across the supply chain</li>
          <li>Viscose sourced from certified sustainable forests</li>
          <li>Zero fabric blends</li>
          <li>Trims & Accessories - GRS certified recycled polyester for elastics, OEKO-TEX certified corozo buttons etc. </li>
        <li>Biodegradable and reusable product packaging  </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Reduce waste in our production by </li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Keeping production inhouse and eliminating stock pile-up</li>
          <li>Upcycling scrap  </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Offset our remaining carbon footprint through certified carbon offsetting projects.</li>
         </ol>
 <h4 class="faq-que "  style="font-size:18px">People: </h4>
        <p>Continue to keep our production in-house or partner with a fair trade manufacturer (more importantly ones open to lower MoQs) in future. We pay fair wages (cut and sew accounts for ~25% of our product prices) that are well above industry standards</p>
<p>Invest in our local communities through our partnership with RangDe on initiatives that align with our values.</p>

 <h4 class="faq-que "  style="font-size:18px">Product: </h4>
        <ol type="1">
<li>Create fashion that is comparable in design, aesthetics, and price to fast fashion, but is also clean, ethical, and long-lasting. We make it easy for our customers to choose sustainable options without having to compromise.  #lookgoodfeelgood  </li>
        <li>Provide complete transparency and traceability on our pricing, materials, suppliers (although at times we are limited by the mutilayeredness of the garment supply chain and our partners need to maintain their trade secrets)</li>
        </ol>

      <p>Have we achieved it all? By no means! We understand that our path to become a truly sustainable brand is a continuous journey that we have just begun and we are determined to stop at nothing to get there!   </p>

      <div style="padding-top:20px">
        <h4 class="faq-que">If we want to be truly sustainable, are we not better off not buying at all?</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">While reducing consumption is one way to reduce our environmental impact, it may not be a practical solution for everyone. Instead, we advocate for a shift towards sustainable fashion that considers the environmental and social impacts of production. This means driving away fast fashion out of fashion and opting for brands that prioritise ethical and sustainable practices.

      </div>
      <div style="padding-top:20px">
        <h4 class="faq-que">What is a carbon footprint and how do you calculate it?
</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">We recognize that the fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, and one way we measure this impact is through carbon footprint. This includes the carbon emissions generated across various stages of the product's lifecycle, from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing to transportation to end-of-life disposal. To calculate our carbon footprint, we use a third-party free tool that takes into account the materials we use, product weight, manufacturing locations, and transportation methods. While the tool provides a good estimate of our carbon footprint (about 70%-80% accurate), we round up to account for any gaps in the calculation. Alternatively, we could conduct a life cycle analysis for a more accurate estimate of our impact, but this would be prohibitively expensive for a young brand like ours and we are better off spending that on offsets and other impact initiatives.

      <div style="padding-top:20px">
        <h4 class="faq-que">What is carbon offsetting and how do you choose projects for offsetting?
</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">Carbon offsetting refers to investing in environmental projects in order to balance out carbon footprint. At SoE, using Greensparkâ€™s services, we invest in global UN certified projects such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and reforestation to offset our carbon footprint. 
</P><br>
        <p>We choose projects that are </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Verified under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
</li>
          <li>Designed to reduce future emissions
</li>
          <li>Located locally or in developing countries 
</li>
          <li>Designed to provide social benefits and employment opportunities for local communities attached to the initiatives, such as plastic waste collection, clean energy cooking stoves etc.     

</li>

       <div style="padding-top:20px">
        <h4 class="faq-que">Is carbon offsetting the ultimate nirvana?</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">Definitely not, carbon offsetting is one of the tools available to reduce carbon emissions. It should be seen as a complementary measure rather than a solution in itself. The controversy around carbon offsetting is if a business uses offsetting as a way to avoid changing their environmentally unfriendly ways i.e. polluting in one place and offsetting in another.  
Our approach to offsetting is to reduce carbon emissions as much as we can and offset the rest (after all, the less we emit, the less it will cost us to go carbon neutral)

        <h4 class="faq-que">What is Earth Positive?
</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">While there are many definitions of what Earth Positive is, simply put it means giving back to the earth more than we take, such that there is a net positive impact on the environment. In addition to offsetting our carbon footprint, we invest in tree planting, plastic waste rescue from the oceans and also invest in local communities, making our contribution earth positive

       <div style="padding-top:20px">
        <h4 class="faq-que">Why do you use materials imported from other countries?
</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">While we would love to use only locally grown materials, the reality is that different climates and growing conditions can affect the quality and availability of certain fibres, whether it is Lyocel or Viscose from responsibly managed forests in Canada or Sweden, Hemp from China or Linen from Europe. While the raw material has origins from outside India, weaving, dyeing and manufacturing still happen locally. Though we would love to limit our sourcing to only locally grown materials, we also need to meet the demands of today's consumers. Importantly, we are better off sourcing sustainable materials from outside than using materials made using fossil fuels. When it comes to sustainability, we live in a very connected world!

</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">No, we do not earn interest from our social investments and neither do we withdraw the repayment proceeds. Nominal interest is charged to establish a sense of responsibility and accountability for those receiving the investment. The initial investments along with the interest is reinvested in other causes creating a self-sustaining cycle of impact and reaching more beneficiaries over time.

</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">There is no additional cost for the carbon offset or tree planting initiatives or social investments we undertake. It comes straight from our profits (er from our margins)!

</h4>
        <P class="faq-ans" style="color:#777777">In order to eliminate inventory pile-up and reduce waste, we have an inhouse production team that is paid fair wages, way higher than industry average. As a result our production costs tend to be higher
