Instead, we advocate for a shift towards sustainable fashion that considers the environmental and social impacts of production. This means driving away fast fashion out of fashion and opting for brands that prioritise ethical and sustainable practices.","ques33":"What is a carbon footprint and how do you calculate it?","ans33":"We recognize that the fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, and one way we measure this impact is through carbon footprint. This includes the carbon emissions generated across various stages of the product's lifecycle, from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing to transportation to end-of-life disposal. To calculate our carbon footprint, we use a third-party free tool that takes into account the materials we use, product weight, manufacturing locations, and transportation methods. While the tool provides a good estimate of our carbon footprint (about 80%-85% accurate), we round up to account for any gaps in the calculation. Alternatively, we could conduct a life cycle analysis for a more accurate estimate of our impact, but this would be prohibitively expensive for a young brand like ours and we are better off spending that on offsets and other impact initiatives.","ques34":"What is carbon offsetting and how do you choose projects for offsetting?","ans34":"<p class=\"faq-ans\" style=\"color:#777777;padding-bottom:0px !important;margin-bottom:0px\">Carbon offsetting refers to investing in environmental projects in order to     balance out carbon footprint. At SoE, in partnership with Greenspark, we invest in global UN certified projects such as     renewable energy, energy efficiency, and reforestation to offset our carbon footprint. <\/p><br> <p class=\"uk-margin-remove\">We choose projects that are <\/p> <ul class=\"custom-list\" style=\"text-indent: -16px;\">     <li>Verified under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change <\/li>     <li>Designed to reduce future emissions <\/li>     <li>Located locally or in developing countries <\/li>     <li>Designed to provide social benefits and employment opportunities for local communities attached to the         initiatives, such as plastic waste collection, clean energy cooking stoves etc. <\/li> <\/ul>","ques35":"Is carbon offsetting the ultimate nirvana?","ans35":"Definitely not, carbon offsetting is one of the tools available to reduce carbon emissions. It should be seen as a complementary measure rather than a solution in itself. The controversy around carbon offsetting is if a business uses offsetting as a way to avoid changing their environmentally unfriendly ways i.e. polluting in one place and offsetting in another. Our approach to offsetting is to reduce carbon emissions as much as we can and offset the rest (after all, the less we emit, the less it will cost us to go carbon neutral).","ques36":"What is Earth Positive?","ans36":"While there are many definitions of what Earth Positive is, simply put it means giving back to the earth more than we take, such that there is a net positive impact on the environment. In addition to offsetting our carbon footprint, we invest in tree planting, plastic waste rescue from the oceans and also invest in local communities, making our contribution earth positive.","ques37":"Why do you use materials imported from other countries?","ans37":"While we would love to use only locally grown materials, the reality is that different climates and growing conditions can affect the quality and availability of certain fibres, whether it is Lyocel or Viscose from responsibly managed forests in Canada or Sweden, Hemp from China or Linen from Europe. While the raw material has origins from outside India, weaving, dyeing and manufacturing still happen locally. Though we would love to limit our sourcing to only locally grown materials, we also need to meet the demands of today's consumers. Importantly, we are better off sourcing sustainable materials from outside than using materials made using non-sustainable materials such as conventional cotton or synthetics. When it comes to sustainability, we live in a very connected world!","ques38":"How does your partnership with Rang De work?","ans38":"We partner with RangDe by investing in sustainable livelihoods and aim to create a positive impact that lasts beyond the initial investment, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable future. With every purchase, we allocate a portion of the proceeds to social investment and keep the investment in circulation.","ques39":"How do you choose what projects to fund?","ans39":"We choose projects that align with our values such as organic farming, weaving and artisanal communities, rural entrepreneurship etc.","ques40":"Do you earn interest from your investments on Rang De?","ans40":"No, we do not earn interest from our social investments and neither do we withdraw the repayment proceeds. Nominal interest is charged to establish a sense of responsibility and accountability for those receiving the investment. The initial investments along with the interest is reinvested in other causes creating a self-sustaining cycle of impact and reaching more beneficiaries over time.","ques41":"Who pays for all these investments?","ans41":"There is no additional cost for the carbon offset or tree planting initiatives or social investments we undertake.

To achieve this, we believe that cleaner fashion should be accessible to everyone, and therefore, inclusivity is fundamental to us. Given the higher demand in standard sizes, we keep safety stock from XS to XL generally. However, since we make on demand, we encourage you to use our custom order option under sizing to get it made just for you.","ques46":"Do you customise clothes?

Please note that we do not provide any other non-size related alterations.","ques47":"Which size should I choose?","ans47":"We suggest referring to our size chart to determine the appropriate size for your purchase. Alternatively, you could use our custom order feature, to get the product stitched per your measurements. If you’re unsure, we request you to write to us at hello@shadesofearth.co and we will get back to you at the earliest.","ques27":"What materials do you use?","ans27":"<p class=\"faq-ans\" style=\"color:#777777\">Every material sourcing decision makes a difference to our Planet and its ecosystems.

Transparency is at the core of our values, and we're committed to being upfront about everything we do, how we do it, and why we do it, even when we don’t get it right.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Sustainability should neither be a luxury nor limiting. Yet, many brands have made it so, passing the tradeoffs of sustainable fashion onto their customers. We're flipping the script as we made it our mission to make sustainable fashion the norm, not the exception. We're focused on making the right thing the easy thing, without compromising great style, quality, affordability, and fit. It's a lofty goal, we are far from achieving it but what is life without a challenge? Join us in changing the industry and moving the needle on sustainability.<br\/><\/p>"}},"Breaking-the-mould":{"type":"Breaking-the-mould","settings":{"main_heading":"Source to Shelf","main_paragraph":"We practise transparency and take you through the notoriously opaque and complex supply chain, so you know where the clothes came from, how they were made, and under what conditions.","sub_heading":"Uncovering the Story Behind each Garment"}},"about-logo-signifies":{"type":"about-logo-signifies","settings":{"main_logo":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/leaf.webp","main-head":"What our Logo signifies","leaves_content":"The Element Leaves symbolise the power of nature - its vitality and renewal.
