      <p>
        We accept returns of unused products within 7 days of the order delivery date.

      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we are unable to provide refunds for products due to the significant amount of effort and resources invested in the design, production, and operations of each and every item. However, we will issue refunds for fulfillment errors, such as incorrect shipments or missing items. If you are eligible for a refund, it will be processed through the original payment method and should be completed within one week of the request being initiated.

      <h2>Exchanges</h2>
      <p>
        We offer size exchanges and store credits for eligible products. Size exchanges are available exclusively for the same product, style, and color that you originally purchased. If the desired size or color is unavailable, we will issue store credits for the amount spent. Please note that items on sale or discounted will not be eligible for exchange or return.

        Store credits issued for exchanges will be valid for 1 year from the date of issue. You can use these credits to make future purchases on our website.

      <h2>Exchange Process</h2>
      <p>
        To initiate an exchange, please visit our website's Returns page and provide your order number and email ID. Depending on availability, you can choose to request a size exchange or store credits. Once we receive your exchange request, please allow up to 3 business days for us to process it. The pick-up and return to our studio may take up to an additional 10 business days. We will arrange a reverse pick-up for the first exchange, and the return/exchange costs will be covered by us. However, for any subsequent exchange requests, the shipping costs will have to be borne by you.
